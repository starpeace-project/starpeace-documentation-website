        Now you are ready to create your first company. Every company in STARPEACE must be based on a Seal; a collection
        of technologies and designs that provides companies with certain strengths and weaknesses, and a distinct
        building look. Seals are authorized by IFEL, and held by Seal Holders: five companies that are licensed to
        operate in the new worlds. In total, there are five different seals in STARPEACE:

      %h3 PGI, or Pure Gaba Initiative
      %p
        It was founded by the wealthiest organization in Europe. PGI provides some of the
        best technologies available. Those who seek efficiency and quality will be pleased with this Seal. However,
        you may find that their designs are sometimes expensive.

      %h3 Mariko Enterprises
      %p
        Mariko Enterprises offers highly competitive solutions based on knowledge and technologies developed by the
        Japanese in the last century. Their designs are famous for the small number of workers required.

      %h3 Dissidents
      %p
        Markus Bl√∂mke, founder of the IFEL, introduced this Seal holder to balance the political landscape of the
        colonies. Most of the dissident's technology was produced by a hippie settlement in Madagascar. Their designs
        are quite functional and ideal for beginners.

    .documentation-body
      %h3 The Moab
      %p
        The Moab is a religious order. A wealthy German immigrant founded it the last century in Texas. Moab is a
        state of mind that can be achieved only by a sadomasochist ritual revealed to those who embrace the cult.
        The Moab paid a lot for their Seal in order for it to prevail in the colonies.

    .documentation-body
      %h3 Magna Corp
      %p
        The IFEL, concerned about overpopulation in the colonies, granted a special Seal to Magna Corp. from Earth.
        Magna Corp. specializes in very large habitation structures. This Seal is licensed only to those who
        achieve the Paradigm Level or have some Nobility points.

        After you've chosen the type of seal you would like your company to operate under, and have given your company a
        name, STARPEACE will create your company and place one hundred million dollars in its coffers. You are now well
        on your way to building your STARPEACE Empire!
