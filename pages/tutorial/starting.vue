    h3 Beginning the game
    p.
      When you first launch STARPEACE from your Start menu, a screen will appear asking for your alias (or nickname)
      and your password. If you already have one, you can enter the game now, otherwise you need to click on New
      Account to create an alias and password. You will be required to provide your name.
    p.
      Once you are logged in with your account, STARPEACE displays the universal map, comprised of different areas,
      each of with has several worlds. Pick one of the worlds you would like to join, depending on your preference for
      crowded or sparse worlds.
    p.
      Now you are ready to create your first company. Every company in STARPEACE must be based on a Seal; a collection
      of technologies and designs that provides companies with certain strengths and weaknesses, and a distinct
      building look. Seals are authorized by IFEL, and held by Seal Holders: five companies that are licensed to
      operate in the new worlds. In total, there are five different seals in STARPEACE:

    h3 PGI, or Pure Gaba Initiative
    p.
      Founded by the wealthiest organizations in Europe, PGI provides some of the best technologies available today. Regardless of your level, if you seek efficiency and quality PGI is the way to go.

    p.
      PGI industries are efficient and showcase the best production quality available, but its facilities are very expensive. PGI is the only Seal allowed to produce Paper and Printing Materials in the new worlds. Chemicals, clothing, residentials and commerce centers are its strength."

    h3 Mariko Enterprises
    p.
      Mariko Enterprises offers highly competitive solutions based on the knowledge developed by the Japanese in the last century.

    p.
      Since Mariko Industries are highly automated, they need fewer workers and are very efficient. Their smaller structures are relatively low priced and guarantee less pollution. Plastic production and CDs are reserved to the Mariko Seal. Its strongest business areas are electronic components, lawyers, offices, household appliances and business machines.

    h3 Dissidents
    p.
      Introduced by Markus Blomke - founder of the IFEL - to balance the colonies' political landscape, most of the Dissident technology was designed to be ideal for beginners by a hippie settlement in Madagascar.

    p.
      Dissidents' buildings sport very low prices, however the production quality is low and the efficiency level is not the best available. Dissidents have the exclusivity on the production of Liquors, Toys and Wood. Best performance is in farming, software, bars and media.

    h3 The Moab
    p.
      A religious order, the Moab was founded in Texas by a wealthy German immigrant. The Moab is a state of mind that can only be achieved by a sadomasochist ritual revealed only to those who embrace the cult. The Moab paid a lot for their Seal in order for it to prevail in the colonies.

    p.
      Thanks to the centralization of all the civic buildings in the Correctional, this seal is the best in fighting crime and fire. Moab has the exclusivity of the oil-gas production chain: oil rigs, refineries and gas stations; the best mining and chemicals; good high and low class residentials.

    h3 Magna Corp
    p.
      The IFEL, concerned about overpopulation in the colonies, granted a Special Seal to Magna Corp from Earth.

    p.
      Magna specializes in very large structures: Archologies (massive residential buildings) and huge Commercial Centers. So far the only Industry available to them is the Movie Studios. This Seal can only be licensed to investors who achieved Paradigm level.

      After you've chosen the type of seal you would like your company to operate under, and have given your company a

      on your way to building your STARPEACE Empire!
