    h3 Construction
    p.
      To build Public Facilities just go to Public facilities in your build menu. With the exception of the monuments,
      who needs to be researched, they are available from the start. We recommend that you build public facilities only
      after you have done everything else and your company is stable, as they require a fair amount of money.
      Predictably, public facilities do not provide you with an income, but do add to your prestige, which plays a
      major role in supporting your political ambitions. Therefore, if you are planning to campaign for the mayoral
      seat in a city, it would be wise to build some public facilities even before you announce your candidacy. However,
      build was is within your means; if you are not currently seeking the mayor's seat, the research you do in your
      different headquarters might give you all the prestige you need.

    h3 Attracting Residents
    p.
      In order to attract people to their cities, some might be tempted to build hospitals and other big public
      facilities, but the best thing to do is let the mayor himself build them. When it comes to health coverage,
      things can be very expensive. However, if the mayor refuses, then you might not have a choice. Police and fire
      stations are far less expensive, but you still should try the mayor first. As an apprentice, you should
      concentrate most on your survival and the stability of your company. Public facilities come later on, when you
      have money to spend. Parks are one of the choices, they are a very good investment, as far as public facilities
      go, you might consider putting them near your high residential buildings since they enjoy clean, green areas.

    h3 Prestige and Cost
    p.
      Public facilities may augment your prestige by 10 or even 20 points sometimes. Furthermore, they motivate other
      people to move into your town, because of the services and the beauty. The only drawback is that public
      facilities don't provide you with any direct income, and their benefits are shared by the entire vicinity or even
      the entire city. The mayor should really shoulder the burden of providing public facilities for the city, but in
      his absence the ideal would be that all the players share in the responsibility, dividing costs up amongst
      themselves. On a city level, the investment in public facilities is easily compensated by the overall economic
      health of the city.
