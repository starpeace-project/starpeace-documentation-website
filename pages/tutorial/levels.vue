        There are six different player levels in STARPEACE. Throughout the game, you will have to reach certain
        achievements in order to be eligible to move up to the next level.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Apprentice
      p.
        With the apprentice title, you get all the basic buildings, including all the headquarters that provide you
        with a chance to research and build your business in order to gain enough money and prestige to move on to
        the next level. Apprentices are protected by the economy in several ways. When they demolish a building they
        get their investment back, but only if they bought the raw materials at the construction site (construction
        work force and possibly business machine and machinery) from the Trade Center. At the end of the year, half
        of the money they have spent in researches will be returned to them by the IFEL. They also have priority,
        over players who are not apprentices, in supply and client lists. However, apprentices have a very strict
        limit on the number of buildings they can build, they cannot own more than 50. They must level up if they
        want to grow their companies beyond that point. To move to the next level of entrepreneur, you must be making
        $1,000/hour or more, and be able to pay back the original $100,000,000 given to you by the IFEL at the start.

      h3 Entrepreneur
      p.
        At the level of entrepreneur, as a reward, you will gain access to some new options: malls, supermarkets and
        monuments. This time, it will become harder to demolish buildings since the refund is limited to only 2/3 of
        the price paid to build them (again only the portion they bought from the Trade Center). They cannot own more
        than 100 facilities. To move to the next level, tycoon, you must have an average income of $5,000/hour or
        more, have over 100 Prestige and have $500,000,000 in your coffers.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Tycoon
      p.
        Once at the tycoon level, the game begins to get much harder. The first thing you will notice is that you
        cannot buy anything from the Trade Center. This means either finding supplies from another player or getting
        them from your own factories. You will not have the privilege of getting any of your research reimbursed, as
        you did at the previous levels. When you demolish, you will not get any money back. As a tycoon, you can
        build up to 200 buildings. This time you're on your own!

    .documentation-body
      h3 Master
      p.
        You will have access to yet more cool technologies and industry types.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Paradigm
      p.
        This is a crucial milestone in your evolution, you will, for the first time, have access to the Magna Seal.
        This Seal will allow you to build huge residential structures, which will not only boost your business but
        also your prestige. This is the first level at which you can transcend and get your first Nobility Points.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Legend
      p.
        You have already been consecrated as a living example of excellence and you may want to start planning your
        transcendence, the natural conclusion of your first cycle as a tycoon in STARPEACE.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Beyond Legend
      p.
        The final stage, but you can level as much as you want. Be careful, the requisites are designed in such a way
        that the money per hour per facility increases all the time, so it will be harder and harder to meet them.
        Moreover, if at the end of the year, you don't meet the requisite of the level you are currently in than you
        will drop to the previous level. In the process of dropping a level, you will also lose one and a half
        prestige that was gained originally upon having reached that level.
