      p.
        The first time you make money in STARPEACE is an event you won't likely forget. No matter how well
        you organize your company, organization alone won't make you profitable.
      p.
        How do you become profitable then? Of course, it all boils down to the fact that you have to generate more
        income than expenses. The bad news is that aside from that, there is no golden rule.
      p.
        It's pretty much like real life. The entire economy is a delicate balance of supply and demand. You need
        to find your place in the economy and grow from there. Big companies can have a profound impact on the
        economy, to the point -if operated properly- they can create a demand they can exploit later. Smaller
        companies have the advantage of being much less expensive to operate, but they must find the right niche
        in order to profit.
      p.
        Here are a few other tricks that will help you get started.

      h3 Minimize salaries
      p.
        Are you a capitalist or not? Salary is a big money-eater. If there is high unemployment in your city, what's
        the point of keeping salaries high? Unemployment is your friend. There won't be a shortage of workers with
        unemployment around.
      p.
        While you do this we recommend that you check the Spending Power of the population. As it becomes low, people
        stop buying goods, and that's something you don't want.
      p.
        Ideally, the investors in the city and the Mayor should work on making the city desirable enough so that
        people will move in even without a job. By creating a nice pool of unemployment, you can remind your workers
        how lucky they are to have their lousy jobs. Low salaries can always be offset by selling goods at lower
        prices. This can become very profitable when the technology that produces goods more efficiently is in place.

      h3 Don't buy stuff you don't want
      p.
        This can happen when you are inexperienced managing warehouses. Be careful to activate in a Warehouse only
        the wares you need and, when you do it, set the maximum price you are willing to pay for them. Some
        unscrupulous investors could sell highly priced goods to your warehouses if you don't do it.

      h3 High quality doesn't mean good
      p.
        High quality goods are always pricey. You will never make money from selling high quality stuff to low class,
        since the price would be too high for them. If you do make money, then another player has to be losing it, and
        this is a situation that is unlikely to last.
      p.
        Always try to ensure your stores are as specialized as possible. That is, if you are selling in a low class
        neighborhood, then you should buy low quality-low price goods, so you can sell them at a price they will buy
        and you can make profit. The same applies to middle class and high class.

      h3 Generously demolish under-used buildings
      p.
        Let's say you built a factory no one wants to buy from. You might choose to keep it just in case its
        production becomes needed later. This is wrong. If it is not generating any money, you should demolish it.
        Remember: while you are at the Apprentice Level, you can demolish all you want and still get all the money back.
      p.
        This rule applies not only to factories, but also to every facility you were expecting to profit from.

      h3 Avoid civic buildings
      p.
        The city is in dire need of hospitals? Go to the townhall and click on Rate the Mayor and post a column asking
        for them, but never, ever build the hospital yourself.
      p.
        The only civic building that could be justifiable for a small company to build would be a police station. In
        some cases crime could be affecting a residential area that belongs to you. In the event the Mayor refuses to
        build a police station in the area, you won't have any other choice, but to build it yourself.
      p.
        Otherwise, leave civic buildings for players who are interested in politics. For newbies like you, survival
        is the top priority.

      h3 Factories do not print money
      p.
        There is a threshold, beyond which the price of a product cannot drop, without the factory loosing money. Make
        sure you set a price that will cover your costs: expenditures in salaries and supplies. If at this price, none
        of the customers in your client list actually buys your product, or they only buy it in small quantities, then
        you have a problem.
      p.
        You could always raise the factory's operating ratio by lowering the price, but since you would lose money this
        makes no sense. The only alternative is to cut your expenses or get customers that will buy your merchandise.
      p.
        Factories spend money on supplies and workforce. You could try reducing salaries, but only take that measure if
        you haven't recently already done so. Next you need to ensure you are getting the cheapest supplies available.
        Sometimes the list the default list is not representative of the cheapest available. Try searching for new
        suppliers, and keep your fingers crossed.

      h3 Skip repairing Real Estate property
      p.
        Real Estate properties can turn ugly sometimes. This happens because crime or pollution is high, maintenance low,
        or simply because almost nobody is willing to move into your building. This ugliness further damages the
        desirability of the area, thus having a negative impact on the other buildings in the neighborhood.
      p.
        Repairing the building will restore it to its original condition, and the ugliness effect will disappear. However,
        if you don't eliminate the real cause of the problem, the building will have the same problems again after a
        couple of years.

      h3 Have patience!
      p.
        Before you manage to create your first successful company, you will go through several failures. Even the best
        players declared bankruptcy (sometimes up to five times) while they were learning the game.
      p.
        You can think of this in terms of getting killed in massive RPGs. It is not something you like, but it is
        necessary. Otherwise, the game would be too easy and much less fun.
      p.
        If you don't make it the first time (or the first couple of times) you try STARPEACE, reset your account
        and try something different. The more you try, the more you will learn, and the better you will become!
