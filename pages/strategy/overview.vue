        You’ve just received 100 million dollars from the IFEL to colonize a new world. This is a lot of money, if
        you only spent it on personal items, like food, clothes or a trip to the Moon. However, in this case, you

        You need to understand that planning is key—random spending will get you nowhere fast. While 100 million
        dollars may seem like a lot, keep in mind that a single large factory could cost you 80 million dollars, and
        then there are the technologies you need to research that can cost up to 1 billion dollars to develop.
