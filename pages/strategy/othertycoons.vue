      Other Tycoons can be tricky. No manual can really thoroughly teach you how to deal with your fellow humans.
      STARPEACE is more complex than shooting at each other or clearing dungeons together. Expect to see a wide
      range of human behavior, from cooperation and friendship to treachery and direct opposition. Each STARPEACE
      world can host anywhere from 100 to more than 300 players.
    %p
      Luckily enough, the realistic economic model rewards cooperation and friendship over sheer confrontation.
      Although there is a lot of competition going on, most of it is based on fair play, since the economy simply
      doesn't allow otherwise.

    %h3 Politics and Communication
    %p
      The political system has also being designed in such a way so that politicians cannot abuse their powers,
      yet they still can be a significant force.
    %p
      There are several ways you can communicate with other players. Aside from internal chat and email, you can
      also post your comments on the local newspapers. If you have something to say about the mayor, this is where
      you can vent or praise. What you state there will actually have an impact on the Mayor's reputation with the
      populace. If too many investors publicly complain about the mayor, he could get fired from office.

    %h3 Alliances
    %p
      In general, we recommend that you make a few friends and try to work together. Although the very design of
      the game won't force you to do so, in order to succeed, alliances with other players will give you a
      significant advantage.

    %h3 Common Courtesy
    %p
      Very important: please try to be polite. STARPEACE is a game that appeals to intelligent people (like you).
      If someone is being rude to you, just ignore that person and report the problem. If you are not nice to
      others your companies could be in trouble, as players will gradually turn their backs on you if not worse.
