        %li

    %h3 Fair Play Policies
    %p
      Players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing STARPEACE. While by no means an
      all-inclusive list of the do's and don'ts of playing STARPEACE, the following provides a suitable
      foundation from which the player can determine what activities are appropriate

    %p.content
      %ol
        %li
          As a mayor, you may not abuse zoning. Specifically, it is forbidden to use your position as mayor
          to arbitrarily zone and rezone areas of the map to derive an advantage for a player or to damage
          the interests of some players.
        %li
          You may not abuse the game so as to entirely monopolize a particular business. While there are
          instances where a player may be the only one operating facilities in a particular business (auto
          dealerships, mines), overly aggressive tactics to drive or keep out competitors may be considered
          contrary to the spirit of the game and the rules of conduct.
        %li
          You must comply with arbitration in contested issues. When two or more players or groups have
          conflicting positions regarding their businesses and their interactions, they are required to
          compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to STARPEACE
          Support's involvement, Support will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise
          mandated by Support will be considered a disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that players
          make every attempt possible to reach a compromise that they can live with. Support should only be
          contacted as a last resort as the compromise they will mandate may not necessarily suit the parties
          to the extent that a player-devised solution would. Note: A 'group' in this case is defined as a
          party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal.
        %li
          Again, foul language is not permitted, in any language. Excessive use of foul language in an
          inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that
          is not consistent with the STARPEACE environment and designed to hurt, will be considered a
          disruption. The existence of the 'Ignore' function is not a license to be profane.
        %li
          To expound upon the general guidelines, you may not harass other players. Harassment is defined
          as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them.
          Harassment can take many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the person or party on the
          receiving end of the action. However, in order to account for those who are excessively
          thin-skinned, STARPEACE Support will make a determination as to whether or not the average
          person would feel 'harassed' and act accordingly.
        %li
          You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area. Zone/Area Disruption is defined as
          any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups, rather than a specific player
          or group of players. This includes actions such as:
          %ul
            %li
              Creating garbage dumps or industrial facilities near residential areas.
            %li
              Excessive and unwarranted use of roads or other structures to occupy land.
            %li
              Refusing to cooperate with the other parties in a contested issue after having been instructed
              to do so by STARPEACE Support.
        %li
          You may not defraud other players. Fraud in all transactions between players will result in
          disciplinary action when confirmed by an internal audit of STARPEACE. Fraud is defined as
          falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense. Examples of this
          activity include but are not limited to offering to give STARPEACE money in exchange for some
          game-related favors (e.g. I will give you 1 billion if you build ten Movie theaters in my town)
          and then refusing to comply without a valid reason.
        %li
          You may not abuse other players, customer service representatives, or the game system. Though some
          of these actions are covered in part by other rules, they deserve their own note here. The following
          would be considered an 'abuse' in-game:
          %ul
            %li
              Hate Mongering - participation in or propagation of hate literature, behavior, or propaganda
              related to real-world characteristics.
            %li
              Sexual Abuse or Harassment - untoward and unwelcome advances of a graphic and sexual nature.
              This includes virtual rape, overt sexual overtures, and stalking of a sexual nature.
            %li
              Sexual Abuse or Harassment - untoward and unwelcome advances of a graphic and sexual nature.
              This includes virtual rape, overt sexual overtures, and stalking of a sexual nature.
            %li
              Attempting to Defraud a Support Representative - petitioning with untrue information with the
              intention of receiving benefits as a result. This includes reporting false bugs, or accusing
              other players of wrongdoing without basis for it.
            %li
              Impersonating a Support Representative - falsely representing yourself as a Game Master.
            %li
              Support Personnel Abuse - sending excessive requests for a Game Master chat or unduly using
              other channels to communicate to a Support representative, making physical threats, or using
              abusive language against a Support representative.
            %li
              Using Threats of Retribution by Game Masters or Support Staff - attempting to convince another
              player that they have no recourse in a disagreement by alleging that Support staff favors one
              party over another.

    %h3 STARPEACE Community Conduct
    %p
      As the STARPEACE Community is an extensions of the game, postings to these forums are bound by the
      STARPEACE website

      forum to which you are posting. This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers,
      operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the
      presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum.
    %p
      You may not, however, post any material that:
    %p.content
      %ul
        %li

    %p.content
      %ul
        %li
          Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting attention paid to your issue.
        %li
          Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to another thread on a
          different subject.
        %li
          Monopolize the front page of any forum by 'bumping' threads of the same or similar content to
          the front. We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs.
        %li
          Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest within the game (e.g. Sit-ins).
        %li
          Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of STARPEACE accounts in exchange for
          real-world money.
        %li
          Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, or the STARPEACE EULA.
        %li
          Advertise products or websites that are not related to STARPEACE.

    %p
      Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on the official STARPEACE
    %p
      Forums will vary depending upon the transgression. It could include any number of the following:
    %p.content
      %ul
        %li Editing of the post.
        %li Deletion of the post/thread.
        %li Closing of the thread.
        %li Suspension (results in user being unable to play STARPEACE for the duration of the suspension).
        %li
          Banishment (results in the user's account being canceled. User will no longer be able to access
          STARPEACE, or any STARPEACE Community).
        %li Legal Action (i.e. contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a threat).
    %p
      Violators of the board's rules may or may not receive a warning before action is taken. In the event
      that a warning is given, the warning will be recorded in the game account and may result in further
      action should the player show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct. Philosophically and
      administratively, there is no distinction between conduct in-game, and conduct in the STARPEACE Community.

  .documentation-body
    %h3 Naming Policy
    %p
      These guidelines apply to all names. Account, company, building, and product names in STARPEACE should
      reflect the genre of the game.
    %p
      The following types of names are unacceptable and are listed in order from the worst to the least offensive:
    %p.content
      %ol
        %li
          Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs,
          and homonyms of these words.
        %li
          Words or combinations of words that produce an offensive result, or that promote racist or religious
          intolerance, homophobia, xenophobia, violence or war against any people, or hate of any group.
        %li
          Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus Christ).
        %li
          Copyrighted or trademarked names of products, characters, services, or concepts (e.g. Oldsmobile,
          Microsoft, Sony).
        %li
          Names from popular media. These names can be either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or

        %li
          The names of Support representatives or STARPEACE project leaders.
        %li
          Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of a
          player or Support representative.
    %p
      For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or words are also unacceptable.
    %p
      If a name is found to be in violation of any of the above polices, a Support manager will then use the following process:

      %ul
        %li
          For category 1 or 2 offenses, a GM will delete the company or account as soon as it is discovered.
          You will not be notified of this deletion. The companies in the account will not be restored or
          reimbursed under any circumstances. Depending on the nature of the offensive name, the account may
          also be subject to disciplinary action including suspension or banning. A GM will not contact you
          before disciplinary action is taken.
        %li
          For categories 3 through 7, the GM will contact you either in-game or via email to notify you of
          the need for a name change. Please be aware that if you do not choose a name that is in accordance
          with this naming policy at the time of creation, a new name will be assigned to your account or
          company and this name will not be changed. A name change for a company or an account will not cause
          a reset for the company (or all companies under the account).
    %p
      %b Conditions for Name Changes:
      &nbsp;Names will not be changed unless they violate the Naming Policy. Players may ask to have their
      account or company name changed, or ask for a confirmation that a name does not violate these rules.
