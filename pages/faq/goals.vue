      %h3 What kind of game is STARPEACE?
      %p
        We are committed to the creation of a game that essentially offers all game genres into one cohesive and highly
        entertaining experience. We believe economy is a good starting point, so we started by developing an economic
        model of a contemporary human society. So that's the kind of game it is today: a real-time economic strategy game.

      %h3 What is the objective of STARPEACE?
      %p
        The main objective is to have fun while people learn about the economy and how to run a company. However, while
        you're doing that you need to interact with all kinds of people and figure out your role in this new society.

      %p
        STARPEACE is a massive online game. That is, you need to be connected to the Internet so you can play. This also
        mean that you will be competing or collaborating with hundreds or thousands of players in the same world.
        STARPEACE worlds keep running even when nobody is connected to them. You will be strongly tempted to reconnect
        time after time to see how your businesses have grown while you were outside.

        You will be a VIP in an earthling colony. You will receive $100,000,000 that you will have to multiply.
        You will be able to build more than 300 different kinds of economic facilities: residential properties,
        industrial installations, office towers, TV stations etc. Among other things, you will choose the location
        of your facilities, set prices, decide on marketing budgets, and make deals with other players. You can launch
        your political campaign for mayor in one city and, depending on your political skills, you might be elected;
        once elected you will be responsible for that city and its success. You will establish tax rates, subsidize
        weaker areas of the economy, control social conditions and, ultimately, design the city by defining its
        construction zones. Other players in the same city will have to abide by your rules and vision, but remember
        you will also be accountable. You may even choose to run for president of the world you are playing in. This
        will give you power over the entire world and consecrate your status as excellent player.
