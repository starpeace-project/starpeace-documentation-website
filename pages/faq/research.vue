      h3 What is research?
      p.
        Basically, if you need to know or build something, you will probably need to research it first. In other words,
        researching is a way of making things available to you.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Why do we need to research?
      p.
        This game is as real as it gets. If you have a company, you need to study and research your next move. If you
        could build anything you wanted, there wouldn't be any challenge, would there?

    .documentation-body
      h3 Is there another way to build without researching?
      p.
        Unfortunately, there is not. There are few things you can build right away, without research, but not enough for
        you to be successful.

    .documentation-body
      h3 Why does it cost so much?
      p.
        IFEL didn't give you a hundred million dollars without a way to insure investments.

    .documentation-body
      h3 After I research everything, will I be able to build anything I want?
      p.
        No. You might notice while playing the game that some buildings have certain prerequisites, meaning that you need
        to be at a certain level to be able to build or even research. Therefore, unless you are at the highest level
        possible, you may not have access to build everything.
